            <paragraph>When discussing standards in the context of this workshop, we primarily refer to community-based, grass-roots, standardisation efforts. Different communities have different approaches to developing, maintaining, and promoting their standards. The Computational Modelling in Biology Network (<reference name="COMBINE" refuri="https://co.mbine.org/">COMBINE</reference><target ids="combine" names="combine" refuri="https://co.mbine.org/"></target>) was established to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats for computational models (see <inline ids="id2">Waltemath <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> [<reference internal="True" reftitle="Dagmar Waltemath, Martin Golebiewski, Michael L.

            <paragraph>While sharing a model implementation in any way is significantly better than not sharing at all, unless a model is shared in a standard format, it rapidly becomes inaccessible as software disappears or becomes unusable, requirements can no longer be met, etc. Sharing a model in a standard format ensures that it continues to be accessible - for example, models encoded in CellML or SBML 20 years ago can still be interpreted by current software tools even though the current tools did not exist at all 20 years ago. <inline ids="id3">Mendes [<reference internal="True" reftitle="Pedro Mendes.

            <paragraph>Furthermore, the modularity inherent in these standards enables parts of models to be reused. While tools and methods for the automated discovery and reuse of models and parts of models continue to themselves become more accessible (for example, see <inline ids="id4">[<reference internal="True" reftitle="Niloofar Shahidi, Michael Pan, Soroush Safaei, Kenneth Tran, Edmund J.

            <title>Harmonised semantics to aid comprehension</title>
            <paragraph>Using suitable standards to encode a model and related simulation experiments greatly improves the <reference name="FAIRness" refuri="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIRness</reference><target ids="fairness" names="fairness" refuri="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"></target> of a model, leading to improved tools and methods to help potential users evaluate the credibility of a model they may want to reuse. Beyond the model itself, there is a lot of essential knowledge that needs to be shared alongside the model to enable someone (or some tool) to understand the model. Who created the model, why it was created, how parameters were determined, etc., are all important pieces of knowledge that help potential future uses of a model. This is particularly critical for any model or simulation being translated to clinical applications.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Semantic annotation provides a technical solution for how we can associate additional knowledge with our models. The freedom and wealth of the semantic web, however, provides a platform for everyone to make their annotations in their own very niche manner. Harmonising our annotation approaches and aligning utilised terminologies allows a given community to ensure that crucial knowledge is represented in a manner that makes it Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (<reference name="FAIR" refuri="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR</reference><target ids="fair" names="fair" refuri="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"></target>) throughout that community and potentially more broadly.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Within the SPARC community, for example, the annotation of anatomical entities is now well established with common terminologies being used across all aspects. Segmented image data, anatomical maps, image, cell location, and time series data can all have suitable anatomical locations defined in a manner that is interoperable across the wealth of tools and resources in SPARC. And then, via work with the <reference name="Common Fund Data Ecosystem" refuri="https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem">Common Fund Data Ecosystem</reference><target ids="common-fund-data-ecosystem" names="common\ fund\ data\ ecosystem" refuri="https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem"></target>, this knowledge is then accessible much more broadly than just SPARC.</paragraph>

For each species’ flatmap you are able to explore the relevant content of the repository via the dataset marker points that are displayed on the map. Similarly, the facets on the <reference name="data and model browser" refuri="https://sparc.science/data?type=dataset">data and model browser</reference><target ids="data-and-model-browser" names="data\ and\ model\ browser" refuri="https://sparc.science/data?type=dataset"></target> are only possible due to the extensive and harmonised annotation of the datasets.</paragraph>
            </admonition>
            <paragraph>While it is well established that comprehensive model annotation is an important goal to strive for, it can also be a very tedious task to perform. Doing model annotation correctly is, furthermore, a task that can require significant training. Tools that can automate annotation and ease the burden on model authors are therefore needed. One such tool is An Automated Model Annotation System (<reference name="AMAS" refuri="https://github.com/sys-bio/amas">AMAS</reference>, <inline ids="id7">[<reference internal="True" reftitle="Woosub Shin, John H.

            <paragraph>A modelling study or project will invariably consist of many different resources, and each resource may evolve independently over time.
